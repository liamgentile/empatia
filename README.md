# empatia

## Real-time analysis of your social media comments to identify emotional content.

1. Select which sites you want to enable empatia for. 

2. Write a comment or a post.  As you're typing, empatia will send your text through sentiment.js to determine its emotional polarity.

3. If your comment is positive, you'll see positive reinforcement messages.

4. If your comment is particularly negative, your text will be classified by `SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions`, and you'll receive emotion specific messages (anger, annoyance, disgust, sadness), which may encourage you to rephrase or reconsider your social media engagement.
